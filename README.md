# MobileAcademy2018
This is my final project from Etnetera Mobile Academy 2018.

On this project we learned:
* What does it mean to create a mobile app
* Basic knowledge of Swift language
* Architectural patterns - MVC, MVVM
* Carthage, Cocoapods
* Kingfirsher - downloading and cashing images
* Closures
* Memory management
* Networking
* Unit testing
* And much more

Specially, most of us found love in mobile development and this was just a beginning.

This is my little old-school presentation. 
Today, i would write it differently, use different tools and patterns. Who knows, maybe i will write a new version of this. 🤷🏻‍♂️
